# GetCode
This is a ST3 plugin which:

1. Take the url of a problem such as https://www.codechef.com/problems/INVLIS.
3. Parse the url and get the problem code(In this case it is **INVLIS**).
4. Create a new .cpp or .py file with a pre-determined template(cpp.snippets which is customized via settings).

### Keyboard shortcuts

For all Operating Systems, ctrl+alt+x opens a new dialogue box which takes the problem url as user input 


### How to install
 1. Install Package Control from [here][1]
 2. In Sublime, Open Package Control

 4. At the bottom of the Sublime window, an input box will appear. Paste the URL of this package : [https://github.com/Salil03/GetCode][6].
 5. Now the Repo has been added to Package Control, it's not installed though 

 6. Open Package Control again (like in step 2).

 7. Select `Package Control: Install Packages`

 8. Now you should be able to search for, and install the GetCode Package.

 9. I hope to add the package to Package Control Repository of Sublime Text.

After configuring the settings, ctrl+alt+x opens a new dialogue box which takes the problem url as user input
